## 🌱 Sustainable Mobility in Panama: Traffic & Emissions Analytics


# 📌 Project Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a major contributor to air pollution and CO2 emissions in rapidly growing cities. This project analyzes the role of carpooling as a sustainable mobility strategy in Panama by leveraging real-world traffic and environmental data.

Using regression-based statistical modeling, the project quantifies the relationship between carpool adoption and emission reductions, while also identifying congestion and pollution hotspots to support data-driven urban planning decisions.

# 🎯 Objectives

1. Quantify the impact of carpooling adoption on CO₂ emissions reduction

2. Analyze real-world traffic congestion patterns

3. Identify pollution hotspots in urban areas

4. Provide actionable insights for sustainable transportation policies

# 📊 Methodology

1. Data Collection

- Gathered real-world datasets related to traffic volume, carpooling practices, and environmental emissions

- Integrated data from multiple sources into a unified analytical dataset

2. Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned and normalized traffic and emissions data

- Handled missing values and inconsistencies

- Engineered features relevant to congestion and emissions analysis

3. Statistical Modeling

- Built regression models to study correlations between carpool adoption rates and CO₂ emissions

- Evaluated model performance and statistical significance of predictors

- Analysis & Visualization

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Visualized congestion patterns and pollution hotspots

- Interpreted trends across different urban zones and time periods


# 🔍 Key Findings

- Increased carpool adoption shows a negative correlation with CO₂ emissions, indicating measurable environmental benefits

- Traffic congestion and pollution are spatially concentrated, suggesting targeted intervention opportunities

- Data supports carpooling as a scalable and cost-effective approach to improving urban mobility
